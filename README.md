# Computer Vision Techniques

Computer Vision Assignment to experiment with computer vision concepts and applying them.

Applied the following techniques: 
* image point processing
* linear spatial processing and histogram equalization
* frequency-based processing for interference removal
* perspective distortion of image to planar surface
* edge detection using Sobel and Canny edge detection
* edgel linking using Radon Transform to parameter space
* 3D stereo vision techniques to compute disparity map of an image, utilizing Sum-of-Squares Difference (SSD).
